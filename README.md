# fighting game prototype

## this project doesn't follow any kind of book, manual or any other kind of material.

i just implemented every idea that came to me and a friend of mine so you can say this project is just me trying to figure out how to make a fighting game without making a mess out of the codebase and unfortunately i can't say i didn't. haha :(

i learned quite a few things and the <strong>input system</strong> that allows combos i think was cool, but this entire thing can be done in a better way and i just might, if motivation comes my way.

also i wanted to try out [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [lit](https://lit.dev/), [three.js](https://threejs.org/), and how easy it'd be to build a game with web technologies.

## overall, fun experience
